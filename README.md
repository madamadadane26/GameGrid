# GameGrid


This program is a simple text-based game called "GameGrid." The game is played on a 10x10 grid, where the player starts at the top-left corner (position [0][0]) and can move either right or down in the grid. The objective is to reach the bottom-right corner (position [9][9]) without hitting any obstacles (represented by the value 1). The game's objective is to explore the grid, avoid obstacles, and reach the bottom-right corner as quickly as possible. The game loop continues until either the player reaches the goal, hits an obstacle, or manually stops the game. The grid's contents are printed after each movement, displaying the player's progress.
